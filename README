""" So just go through my stuff, and you will find little digital knick-knacks, but more useful. You'll find a few simple games
such as BattleShip, Guess the Number, or Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock, or calculators for tip, weight grades and averages, etc.
Go ahead and try out my code if you'd like, and if you don't like it, this is the internet, and you are free to go somewhere else
and enjoy posting your status on LifeInvader or whatever it is you do.

If you like my stuff then woop! Good for you. More to come for my little test projects demonstrating my ability in Python. """
