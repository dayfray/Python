So this function first makes the input "word" equal to itself, only all lower case, making it easier to go through.
Then, a new variable, "result" is created as a placeholder for the scores of the letters added together.
Now, a "for" loop is made for going through each "letter" in the input "word", and making the placeholder "result",
equal to itself plus the corresponding letter key in the dictionary "score", then it returns the final "result".






Had the following results what using the above code as it is now:



kemet@kemet-P15xEMx ~ $ python '/home/kemet/Programming Tutorials/Python Tutorials/Python Tutorials - Web Pages/Project Files/Scrabble.py'

What is the word you created in Scrabble? what

Your score is: 10 points.


kemet@kemet-P15xEMx ~ $ python '/home/kemet/Programming Tutorials/Python Tutorials/Python Tutorials - Web Pages/Project Files/Scrabble.py'

What is the word you created in Scrabble? 1

Your score is: None points.
